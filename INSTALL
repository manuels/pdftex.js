INSTALL for pdfTeX 1.40.11
==========================

Try the script build-pdftex.sh in this directory:

,--------
| bash ./build-pdftex.sh
`--------

If it succeeds, you should end up with the file pdftex in
build-pdftex/texk/web2c

If you want to build pdftex in a directory out of the src tree:

,--------
| cd /tmp
| bash /path/to/build-pdftex.sh
`--------

This distribution is a stripped-down version of the TeXlive distribution.
All source code is in the directory src. The code of pdfTeX is in
src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir

If you are using a TeX distribution older than 2005 (e.g. teTeX 2.x), please
first update your complete TeX installation.

Replace the so-named files in your TeX installation with these and regenerate
all formats of your TeX installation (e.g. with "fmtutil --refresh").

If all else fails, follow the clues in README, src/texk/INSTALL and
src/texk/web2c/INSTALL.
